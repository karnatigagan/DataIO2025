### **🚀Advanced Track: Reducing CO₂ Emissions**

💡 *Analyzing vehicle emissions to propose actionable solutions.*

## 🔹 **Challenge Statement:**

Reducing CO₂ emissions from vehicles is essential for combating climate change. Your task is to analyze vehicle emissions data, uncover trends, and propose strategies to reduce emissions.

## 🔍 **Key Objectives:**

✅ Analyze the impact of vehicle characteristics on CO₂ emissions.

✅ Create meaningful visualizations to communicate insights.

✅ Answer key questions such as:

- How do engine size, fuel consumption, and vehicle type impact CO₂ emissions?
- Which vehicle types contribute the most emissions?
- How do CO₂ emissions differ across fuel types?

## 📂 **Datasets:**

[Kaggle: CO₂ Emission by Vehicles](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debajyotipodder/co2-emission-by-vehicles)

[Kaggle: Global Air Pollution](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasibalmuzdadid/global-air-pollution-dataset)

[Kaggle: CO₂ Emission Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drsayed/co2-emission)

## 📜 **Deliverables:**

📊 **Visualization(s):**

At least one meaningful and well-designed visualization (chart, heatmap, or graph) that highlights the relationships between vehicle characteristics and CO₂ emissions.

📑 **Presentation Deck:**

A comprehensive presentation deck that outlines your findings. Include a detailed analysis of CO₂ emissions by vehicle type, fuel type, and other relevant factors. Your presentation should also propose actionable strategies for reducing emissions based on your analysis.

🎥 **Video:**

A 3-5 minute video discussing your findings. The video should provide a clear narrative, emphasizing the most impactful insights from your data and offering recommendations for reducing CO₂ emissions.
